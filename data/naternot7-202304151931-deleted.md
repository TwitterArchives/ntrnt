I am a Holocaust "denier" but I like to be objective. I'm certain that there were numerous German atrocities commited against the Jews, not to mention their forced deportation to labor camps to begin with. <!--1366158672536174597-->

God and family come first and second. Race is a close third but there's a serious problem in this movement of only focusing on race to the point where it's like your religion.
